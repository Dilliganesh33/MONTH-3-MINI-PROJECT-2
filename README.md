# CYBERNAUT - IMAGE VIEWER USING TKINTER

Short image viewer for the "MONTH 3 MINI PROJECT 2" workspace.

**What this repo contains**
- `image_viewer.py`: Simple script to view images from the `images/` folder.
- `images/`: Directory where project images are stored.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Pip

**Install dependencies**
Run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Usage**
From the project root directory run:

```bash
python image_viewer.py
```

The script will load images from the `images/` directory. Add images to that folder to view them.

**Project structure**
- README.md — this file
- image_viewer.py — main viewer script
- requirements.txt — Python packages required
- images/ — drop your image files here

**Troubleshooting**
- If `python` points to Python 2 on your system, run `python3 image_viewer.py` instead.
- If any dependencies fail to install, ensure your pip is up to date: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.

**License**
This project does not include a license file. Add one if you plan to publish the code.
